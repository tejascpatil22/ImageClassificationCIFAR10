# Image Classifcation using Transfer Learning 

## Why is this relevant?
Usual classification algorithms generally help us determine whether a customer belongs to a certain category or not, but it needs structured data about the subject. Image classification looks to break-down the unstructured images to be able to determine what the image represents, which has huge value in use cases like self driving cars or any other implementation that requirs a machine to recognise what object is in front of it

## About this implementation
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. I have used transfer learning here to classify images with high prediction. \
Transfer learning uses pre-built models on similar problems so that we can leverage the already trained model and tweak it to our use case. This saves us a a lot of computation time and money is a fairly common practice in image classification which can have a large amount of data.
